# project_tuberculosis_detection_using_DL
Develop a deep learning-based model to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or showing signs of tuberculosis (TB). The system will preprocess and augment image data, train multiple deep learning models, and evaluate their performance. The final application will provide an interface for uploading X-ray images and receiving predictions.
# Business use cases 
**Early Detection of Tuberculosis:**
Aid radiologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosing TB from X-ray images.
**Automated Screening in Remote Areas:**
Provide medical imaging analysis where radiologists are not readily available.
**Reducing Diagnostic Errors:**
Support decision-making by providing AI-powered second opinions.
**Research and Analysis:**
Help researchers analyze TB trends and model effectiveness in detecting abnormalities.
